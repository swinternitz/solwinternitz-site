      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        The first time I made this, my dog had just had surgery and was wearing the cone. He wasn’t eating, so I did the responsible
        thing and made him boiled chicken. He wanted none of it. But this roulade? Suddenly he was a food critic—he’d only eat it if I
        fed him by hand. I don’t know what that says about him, but it says a lot about roulade.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep coming back to this dish because it’s the best kind of “fancy”: it looks like a restaurant plate, but the technique is
        basically “roll something delicious inside chicken and don’t overcook it.”
      </p>

      <h3>What is a roulade (and why Italy calls it something cuter)</h3>
      <p class="small">
        “Roulade” is the general technique: roll meat (or even pastry) around a filling, cook, then slice to show off the spiral.
        In Italian cooking, roulades are commonly referred to as <em>involtini</em>—literally “little bundles”—and the fillings vary
        wildly: cheeses, cured meats, breadcrumbs, greens, mushrooms, pine nuts, you name it.
      </p>

      <h3>Why this one works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The filling seasons the meat.</strong> Soppressata + capicola bring salt, spice, and fat. Provolone melts and holds it together.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear + gentle finish.</strong> Brown for flavor, then finish without drying it out.</li>
        <li><strong>The sauce is cold and tangy.</strong> Warm roulade + chilled yogurt sauce is a perfect contrast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Variations (same technique, different mood)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classic:</strong> prosciutto + provolone + basil</li>
        <li><strong>Earthy:</strong> sautéed mushrooms + spinach + fontina</li>
        <li><strong>Spicy:</strong> pepperoni + mozzarella + calabrian chili</li>
        <li><strong>Bright:</strong> lemon zest + herbs + parmesan</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>About that side dish</h3>
      <p class="small">
        I served this with sautéed summer squash and roasted cherry tomatoes. If you can find those “Constellation” tomatoes—heirloom-ish,
        colorful, sweet—you get this ridiculously good sauce-y situation in the pan as they roast and collapse. That “tomato confit energy”
        is exactly what the yogurt sauce wants: sweet, roasted acidity to cut through the richness.
      </p>

      <div class="callout small">
        <strong>Make-ahead move:</strong> Assemble + tie the roulade earlier in the day. When it’s dinner time, sear and finish.
        You’ll look calm and competent either way.

          <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the chicken.</strong> Pound to even thickness (plastic wrap helps).</li>
            <li><strong>Season.</strong> Salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning. Optional: thin Dijon smear.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill.</strong> Soppressata + capicola + provolone, leaving a small border.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll + secure.</strong> Roll tight. Tie with twine every 1–1.5 inches (or use toothpicks).</li>
            <li><strong>Sear.</strong> Hot pan + oil. Brown all sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish gently.</strong> 375°F oven until cooked through, then rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Slice + sauce.</strong> Slice thick. Spoon sauce over top.</li>
          </ol>

            <strong>Slice tip:</strong> Use a sharp knife and commit. Hesitation makes the cheese sad.
