      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        The first time I made this, my dog had just had surgery and was wearing the cone. He wasn’t eating, so I did the responsible
        thing and made him boiled chicken. He wanted none of it. But this roulade? Suddenly he was a food critic—he’d only eat it if I
        fed him by hand. I don’t know what that says about him, but it says a lot about roulade.
      </p>

      <div class="callout"><strong>Food nerd note:</strong> Roulade is basically controlled stuffing. The tighter the roll and the more even the thickness, the more predictable the cook—and the better the slices look.</div>
      <p>
        I keep coming back to this dish because it’s the best kind of “fancy”: it looks like a restaurant plate, but the technique is
        basically “roll something delicious inside chicken and don’t overcook it.”
      </p>

      <h3>What is a roulade (and why Italy calls it something cuter)</h3>
      <p class="small">
        “Roulade” is the general technique: roll meat (or even pastry) around a filling, cook, then slice to show off the spiral.
        In Italian cooking, roulades are commonly referred to as <em>involtini</em>—literally “little bundles”—and the fillings vary
        wildly: cheeses, cured meats, breadcrumbs, greens, mushrooms, pine nuts, you name it.
      </p>

      <h3>Why this one works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The filling seasons the meat.</strong> Soppressata + capicola bring salt, spice, and fat. Provolone melts and holds it together.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear + gentle finish.</strong> Brown for flavor, then finish without drying it out.</li>
        <li><strong>The sauce is cold and tangy.</strong> Warm roulade + chilled yogurt sauce is a perfect contrast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Variations (same technique, different mood)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classic:</strong> prosciutto + provolone + basil</li>
        <li><strong>Earthy:</strong> sautéed mushrooms + spinach + fontina</li>
        <li><strong>Spicy:</strong> pepperoni + mozzarella + calabrian chili</li>
        <li><strong>Bright:</strong> lemon zest + herbs + parmesan</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>About that side dish</h3>
      <p class="small">
        I served this with sautéed summer squash and roasted cherry tomatoes. If you can find those “Constellation” tomatoes—heirloom-ish,
        colorful, sweet—you get this ridiculously good sauce-y situation in the pan as they roast and collapse. That “tomato confit energy”
        is exactly what the yogurt sauce wants: sweet, roasted acidity to cut through the richness.
      </p>

      <div class="callout small">
        <strong>Make-ahead move:</strong> Assemble + tie the roulade earlier in the day. When it’s dinner time, sear and finish.
        You’ll look calm and competent either way.

          <ul>
                        <li>2 large chicken breasts (butterflied) <em>or</em> 4 thin chicken cutlets</li>
            <li>8 slices soppressata (or enough to cover the chicken in a single layer)</li>
            <li>6–8 slices capicola</li>
            <li>4 slices provolone</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>

            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil (for searing)</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 tbsp Dijon (thin smear helps everything stick)</li>
    
          </ul>

          <h3>Roasted tomato yogurt sauce</h3>
          <ul>
                        <li>1 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1 cup roasted cherry tomatoes (see note)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp lemon juice + 1 tsp zest</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove (microplaned)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional herbs: 1 tbsp chopped dill or parsley</li>
    
          </ul>

          <div class="note"><strong>Roasted tomato note:</strong> Roast 1 pint cherry tomatoes at 425°F with a drizzle of olive oil + salt until blistered and jammy (20–25 min). Cool, then chop or mash into the yogurt.</div>

          <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep the chicken.</strong> Pound to even thickness (plastic wrap helps).</li>
            <li><strong>Season.</strong> Salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning. Optional: thin Dijon smear.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill.</strong> Soppressata + capicola + provolone, leaving a small border.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll + secure.</strong> Roll tight. Tie with twine every 1–1.5 inches (or use toothpicks).</li>
            <li><strong>Sear.</strong> Hot pan + oil. Brown all sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish gently.</strong> 375°F oven until cooked through (160–165°F internal), then rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Slice + sauce.</strong> Slice thick. Spoon sauce over top.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="callout small">
            <strong>Slice tip:</strong> Use a sharp knife and commit. Hesitation makes the cheese sad.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I assemble the roulade ahead of time?</summary>
          <div class="ans">Yes. Roll and tie it, then refrigerate (covered) up to 24 hours. Let it sit at room temp 20–30 minutes before roasting for more even cooking.</div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I swap the deli meats/cheese?</summary>
          <div class="ans">Absolutely. Keep the same idea: something fatty/salty + something melty. Prosciutto, mortadella, or mozzarella work well; just avoid overstuffing.</div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What’s the best way to reheat leftovers?</summary>
          <div class="ans">Slice and rewarm in a low oven (275°F) until hot. Reheating gently keeps the filling from separating and preserves the crust.</div>
